		<p class="cell">
			The Hernried Center has taken care of patients since 1983.  Our thorough, team-based approach has helped thousands of patients rediscover their future.<br><br>

			Many of our patients who have lost a significant amount of weight have the unfortunate side effect of extra wrinkles and skin laxity.  To provide the same level of outstanding service, we have developed The Finishing Touch Medspa to help patients transform themselves on the outside as well.  Our Menu of Services offers many of the most effective non-surgical aesthetic treatments available anywhere in the country. Our staff is among the most experienced in the area, and we are constantly enhancing their education with advanced trainings and certifications.<br><br>

			We realize that while all the wonderful equipment and a nice location is important, nothing is more important than the way we treat our clients.
