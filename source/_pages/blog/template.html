			If you live in Sacramento, it is likely that you love to get outside and enjoy the fresh air during all seasons. Something that may stop you from living your life to the fullest is having unwanted fat on your body. You may not feel inclined to wear shorts, tank tops, or other active clothing. We would like to tell you about the ways that fat reduction can help you.</p>

			<h2>Fat Reduction is Not Weight Loss</h2>

			<p>
			It is good to mention that these two things are not the same. When you lose weight, your fat cells shrink. Losing weight is typically accomplished by eating less and exercising more. It is the best way for obese individuals to get down to a healthy weight. Fat reduction actually removes fat cells from the body.<br><br>

			One of the ways that fat reduction will help you is it will allow you to finally attain the goals you have been trying to reach for years. It is common for people to think about what their body will look like if they stick with a diet and exercise routine in order to get through their personal struggles and over hurdles. It is common for people to stick with a diet and exercise routine and get over those hurdles but never like what they see when they look in the mirror. Fat reduction treatments are specifically designed for this situation.<br><br>

			The treatments we offer can help you accomplish your goals. We want to give you that body you have imagined as you have been working so hard to exercise and diet. You are going to experience a giant boost in self-confidence. This self-confidence will positively impact a range of areas of your life.<br><br>

			Fat reduction treatments have helped many of our Sacramento clients jumpstart a healthy lifestyle. Once they see how attractive their bodies look after treatment, they want to maintain the results. This helps them to exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, and engage in healthy activities. It may be just the boost you need.<br><br>

			When a person loses weight with diet and exercise, their fat cells shrink. If they are not careful, those fat cells can grow again. When a person uses fat reduction treatments, they actually become resistant to gaining weight in the areas where the fat was removed. So, even if the person gains weight in the future, they are likely to gain weight in areas where more weight will look attractive. For example, a woman may gain a bit more weight in her thighs, hips, and bust as opposed to gaining belly fat.
